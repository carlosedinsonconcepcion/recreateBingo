## Features

### Calling BIngo Numbers
- We need to be able to call out numbers
- Generate Bingo cards for players
- Check their cards when someone calls Bingo.

Once we have got these basics in place, we can then start to add new features
or tweak the way it works.

### Generating Bingo Cards
- We need a Bingo card generator
- Every Bingo card has 25 unique spaces
- Each column contains numbers between $loweBound and $upperBound (inclusive)
- There is 1 free space at the middle of every generated card.

| Column | Lower bound | Upper bound |
| - | -- | -- |
| B |  1 | 15 |
| I | 16 | 30 |
| N | 31 | 45 |
| G | 46 | 60 |
| O | 61 | 75 |

### Checkinig Bingo Cards
- We need to check player's cards when they call Bingo (so that a winner can be decided)
- When a player calls Bingo check if all numbers on his\her card have been called
- Determine whether a player is winner or not
